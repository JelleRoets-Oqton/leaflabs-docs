This repository contains source files used to generate the
documentation for LeafLabs' libmaple and Maple IDE projects [*]. The
HTML documentation generated from these sources is available online:

    http://docs.leaflabs.com

The above URL is the recommended way for users to read the
documentation.  The docs for the latest release are always available
there.

The file README-building.txt explains how to build the HTML docs.

The file README-maintainers.txt contains important information for
maintainers of the documentation (e.g. how to add docs for a new
board, how to cut a release version of the docs, etc.).

[*] libmaple and Maple IDE themselves are in separate repositories:

    https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple
    https://github.com/leaflabs/maple-ide
