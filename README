This directory contains the Sphinx documentation for libmaple.  You
can generate HTML documentation using the Makefile if you have make,
or using make.bat from Windows.

For the impatient, you can build the HTML docs with (on Unix):

    $ sudo easy_install -U Sphinx
    $ make html

Which will produce HTML documentation in build/html.

All of the documentation itself lives in source/.  The directory
source/_static is for static content like style sheets;
source/_templates contains Sphinx templates.

The documentation is written in reStructuredText (reST); it's a Python
thing that they use to produce the docs at python.org (which are
beautiful, if you've never seen them).  You can read more about Sphinx
here:

    http://sphinx.pocoo.org/tutorial.html

Specific information on documenting C and C++ is available here:

    http://sphinx.pocoo.org/domains.html

The file source/conf.py is an autogenerated configuration file; you
can read it yourself.
