Example usage: <preformatted>
A co-routine that blocks on a queue waiting for characters to be received.

     {
Wait for data to become available on the queue.  This assumes the
queue xCommsRxQueue has already been created!
         crQUEUE_RECEIVE( xHandle, xCommsRxQueue, &amp;uxLEDToFlash, portMAX_DELAY, &amp;xResult );</preformatted></para><para><preformatted>Was a character received?
         if( xResult == pdPASS )

Process the character here.

     crEND();

a co-routine.

the first time around the loop.  If the post causes a co-routine
to be woken (unblocked) then xCRWokenByPost will be set to pdTRUE.
In this manner we can ensure that if more than one co-routine is
blocked on the queue only one is woken by this ISR no matter how
many characters are posted to the queue.
